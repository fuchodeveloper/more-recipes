## More-recipes
More-Recipes provides a platform for users to share the awesome and exciting  recipe ideas they have invented or learnt.  Suppose a user comes up with a recipe,  he/she can post it on More-Recipes and  get feedback in form of reviews and votes from other users who explore that recipe. Users can also keep a list of their favorite recipes on the application.

## How it works 
* Users can view various recipes on the application by visiting the app catalog page
* Users can add recipes to the app, but first the user needs to create a new account or sign in
* Authenticated users can do the following on the app:
    * Add a recipe
    * View or modify the recipe he/she added
    * Delete the recipe he/she added
    * Retrieve recipes from the catalog
    * Modify a recipe in the catalog, including upvoting, downvoting, favoriting e.t.c
    * Delete a recipe from the catalog
    * Retrieve favorited recipes from the catalog
    * Add a review for a recipe
    * Retrieve recipes with the most upvotes
